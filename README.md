# Hangman Game in JavaScript
Welcome to the Hangman Game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! This project has been an exciting journey during my learning in the JavaScript module, where I've faced challenges while working with various data structures and their functional methods.

## Game Description
The Hangman Game is a classic implementation of the famous word-guessing game. Use your JavaScript skills to guess the hidden word before the hangman drawing is completed.

## How to Use the Game

## Game Instructions
Select letters to guess the hidden word.
Each incorrect letter draws a part of the hangman.
Try to guess the word before the hangman drawing is completed.
Challenges and Data Structures
During the development of this game, I've faced specific challenges related to data management and structures, such as storing the hidden word, keeping track of guessed letters, and managing player attempts. I've used functional methods to improve code efficiency, although I acknowledge that it could benefit from refactoring.

### Code Refactoring
Since this project has been an integral part of my learning process, the code reflects my evolution and growth in JavaScript. I plan to refactor it to improve code structure and readability, applying the best practices and patterns learned.

### Acknowledgments
I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project while learning. It has been an educational and challenging journey that has allowed me to enhance my skills in JavaScript.
